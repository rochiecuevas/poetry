Cut loose and ride alone!\\nThen Scindia twixt his blistered lips:My Queens Queen shall she be!\\n\\nOf all who ate my bread last night twas she alone that came\\nTo seek her love between the spears and find her crown therein!\\nOne shame is mine to-day. What need the weight of double shame?\\nIf once we reach the Delhi gate, though all be lost, I win!\\n\\nWe rodethe white mare failedher trot a staggering stumble grew,\\nThe cooking-smoke of even rose and weltered and hung low;\\nAnd still we heard the Populzai and still we strained anew,\\nAnd Delhi town was very near, but nearer was the foe.\\n\\nYea, Delhi town was very near when Lalun whispered:Slay!\\nLord of my life, the mare sinks faststab deep and let me die!\\nBut Scindia would not, and the maid tore free and flung away,\\nAnd turning as she fell we heard the clattering Populzai.\\n\\nThen Scindia checked the gasping mare that rocked and groaned for breath,\\nAnd wheeled to charge and plunged the knife a hands-breadth in her side\\nThe hunter and the hunted know how that last pause is death\\nThe blood had chilled about her heart, she reared and fell and died.\\n\\nOur Gods were kind. Before he heard the maidens piteous scream\\nA log upon the Delhi road, beneath the mare he lay\\nLost mistress and lost battle passed before him like a dream;\\nThe darkness closed about his eyes.

of Boh Da Thone\\nWas Captain ONeil of the Black Tyrone,\\n\\nAnd his was a Company, seventy strong,\\nWho hustled that dissolute Chief along.\\n\\nThere were lads from Galway and Louth and Meath\\nWho went to their death with a joke in their teeth,\\n\\nAnd worshipped with fluency, fervour, and zeal\\nThe mud on the boot-heels of Crook ONeil.\\n\\nBut ever a blight on their labours lay,\\nAnd ever their quarry would vanish away,\\n\\nTill the sun-dried boys of the Black Tyrone\\nTook a brotherly interest in Boh Da Thone,\\n\\nAnd, sooth, if pursuit in possession ends,\\nThe Boh and his trackers were best of friends.\\n\\nThe word of a scouta march by night\\nA rush through the mista scattering fight\\n\\nA volley from covera corpse in the clearing\\nA glimpse of a loin-cloth and heavy jade earring\\n\\nThe flare of a villagethe tally of slain\\nAnd  the Boh was abroad on the raid again!\\n\\nThey cursed their luck, as the Irish will,\\nThey gave him credit for cunning and skill,\\n\\nThey buried their dead, they bolted their beef,\\nAnd started anew on the track of the thief,\\n\\nTill, in place of the Kalends of Greece, men said,\\nWhen Crook and his darlings come back with the head.\\n\\nThey had hunted the Boh from the hills to the plain\\nHe doubled and broke for the hills again:\\n\\nThey had crippled his power for rapine and raid,\\nThey had routed him out of his pet stockade,\\n\\nAnd at last, they came, when the Daystar tired,\\nTo a camp deserteda village fired.\\n\\nA black cross blistered the Morning-gold,\\nBut the body upon it was stark and cold.\\n\\nThe wind of the dawn went merrily past,\\nThe high grass bowed her plumes to the blast.\\n\\nAnd out of the grass, on a sudden, broke\\nA spirtle of fire, a whorl of smoke\\n\\nAnd Captain ONeil of the Black Tyrone\\nWas blessed with a slug in the ulnar-bone\\nThe gift of his enemy Boh Da Thone.\\n\\n(Now a slug that is hammered from telegraph-wire\\nIs a thorn in the flesh and a

the Boh returned to the raid anew.\\n\\nBut the Captain had quitted the long-drawn strife,\\nAnd in far Simoorie had taken a wife;\\n\\nAnd she was a damsel of delicate mould,\\nWith hair like the sunshine and heart of gold,\\n\\nAnd little she knew the arms that embraced\\nHad cloven a man from the brow to the waist:\\n\\nAnd little she knew that the loving lips\\nHad ordered a quivering lifes eclipse,\\n\\nOr the eye that lit at her lightest breath\\nHad glared unawed in the Gates of Death.\\n\\n(For these be matters a man would hide,\\nAs a general rule, from an innocent Bride.)\\n\\nAnd

coolies slaved,\\nAnd the cartmen flogged and the escort raved,\\n\\nAnd out of the jungle, with yells and squeals,\\nPranced Boh Da Thone, and his gang at his heels!\\n\\nThen belching blunderbuss answered back\\nThe Sniders snarl and the carbines crack,\\n\\nAnd the blithe revolver began to sing\\nTo the blade that twanged on the locking-ring,\\n\\nAnd the brown flesh blued where the bayonet kissed,\\nAs the steel shot back with a wrench and a twist,\\n\\nAnd the great white bullocks with onyx eyes\\nWatched the souls of the dead arise,\\n\\nAnd over the smoke of the fusillade\\nThe Peacock Banner staggered and swayed.\\n\\nThe Babu shook at the horrible sight,\\nAnd girded his ponderous loins for flight,\\n\\nBut Fate had ordained that the Boh should start\\nOn a lone-hand raid of the rearmost cart,\\n\\nAnd out of that cart, with a bellow of woe,\\nThe Babu fellflat on the top of the Boh!\\n\\nFor years had Harendra served the State,\\nTo the growth of his purse and the girth of his pt.\\n\\nThere were twenty stone, as the tally-man knows,\\nOn the broad of the chest of this best of Bohs.\\n\\nAnd twenty stone from a height discharged\\nAre bad for a Boh with a spleen enlarged.\\n\\nOh, short was the strugglesevere was the shock\\nHe dropped like a bullockhe lay like a block;\\n\\nAnd the Babu above him, convulsed with fear,\\nHeard the labouring life-breath hissed out in his ear.\\n\\nAnd thus in a fashion undignified\\nThe princely pest of the Chindwin died.*****\\nTurn now to Simoorie, where, all at his ease,\\nThe Captain is petting the Bride on his

       " 'OH, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet, Till Earth and Sky stand presently at Gods great Judgment Seat; But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth, When two strong men stand face to face, tho they come from the ends of the earth! Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border side, And he has lifted the Colonels mare that is the Colonels pride: He has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day, And turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away. Then up and spoke the Colonels son that led a troop of the Guides: Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides? Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan, the son of the Ressaldar, If ye know the track of the morning-mist, ye know where his pickets are. At dusk he harries the Abazaiat dawn he is into Bonair, But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare, So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly, By the favor of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tongue of Jagai, But if he be passed the Tongue of Jagai, right swiftly turn ye then, For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamals men. There is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between, And ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen. The Colonels son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he, With the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell, and the head of the gallows-tree. The Colonels son to the Fort has won, they bid him stay to eat Who rides at the tail of a Border thief, he sits not long at his meat. He s up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly, Till he was aware of his fathers mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai, Till he was aware of his fathers mare with Kamal upon her back, And when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack. He has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide. Ye shoot like a soldier, Kamal said. Show now if ye can ride. It s up and over the Tongue of Jagai, as blown dust-devils go, The dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe. The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above, But the red mare played with the snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a glove. There was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between, And thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho never a man was seen. They have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn, The dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn. The dun he fell at a water-coursein a woful heap fell he, And Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free. He has knocked the pistol out of his handsmall room was there to strive, T was only by favor of mine, quoth he, ye rode so long alive: There was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree, But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee. If I had raised my bridle-hand, as I have held it low, The little jackals that flee so fast, were feasting all in a row: If I had bowed my head on my breast, as I have held it high, The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly. Lightly answered the Colonels son:Do good to bird and beast, But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast. If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away, Belike the price of a jackals meal were more than a thief could pay. They will feed their horse on the standing crop, their men on the garnered grain, The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain. But if thou thinkest the price be fair,thy brethren wait to sup, The hound is kin to the jackal-spawn,howl, dog, and call them up! And if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack, Give me my fathers mare again, and I ll fight my own way back! Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet. No talk shall be of dogs, said he, when wolf and gray wolf meet. May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath; What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death? Lightly answered the Colonels son: I hold by the blood of my clan: Take up the mare for my fathers giftby God, she has carried a man! The red mare ran to the Colonels son, and nuzzled against his breast, We be two strong men, said Kamal then, but she loveth the younger best. So she shall go with a lifters dower, my turquoise-studded rein, My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain. The Colonels son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end, Ye have taken the one from a foe, said he; will ye take the mate from a friend? A gift for a gift, said Kamal straight; a limb for the risk of a limb. Thy father has sent his son to me, I ll send my son to him! With that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain-crest He trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance in rest. Now here is thy master, Kamal said, who leads a troop of the Guides, And thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides. Till Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed, Thy life is histhy fate it is to guard him with thy head. So thou must eat the White Queens meat, and all her foes are thine, And thou must harry thy fathers hold for the peace of the border-line. And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur.  They have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no fault, They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and salt: They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut sod, On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the Wondrous Names of God. The Colonels son he rides the mare and Kamals boy the dun, And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one. And when they drew to the Quarter-Guard, full twenty swords flew clear There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer. Ha done! ha done! said the Colonels son. Put up the steel at your sides! Last night ye had struck at a Border thiefto-night t is a man of the Guides!  Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the two shall meet, Till Earth and Sky stand presently at Gods great Judgment Seat; But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth, When two strong men stand face to face, tho they come from the ends of the earth.',\n",

       " 'WHEN the flush of a new-born sun fell first on Edens green and gold, Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched with a stick in the mould; And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart, Till the Devil whispered behind the leaves, It s pretty, but is it Art?  Wherefore he called to his wife, and fled to fashion his work anew The first of his race who cared a fig for the first, most dread review; And he left his lore to the use of his sonsand that was a glorious gain When the Devil chuckled Is it Art? in the ear of the branded Cain.  They builded a tower to shiver the sky and wrench the stars apart, Till the Devil grunted behind the bricks: It s striking, but is it Art? The stone was dropped at the quarry-side and the idle derrick swung. While each man talked of the aims of Art, and each in an alien tongue.  They fought and they talked in the North and the South, they talked and they fought in the West, Till the waters rose on the pitiful land, and the poor Red Clay had rest Had rest till the dank, blank-canvas dawn when the dove was preened to start, And the Devil bubbled below the keel: It s human, but is it Art?  The tale is as old as the Eden Treeand new as the new-cut tooth For each man knows ere his lip-thatch grows he is master of Art and Truth; And each man hears as the twilight nears, to the beat of his dying heart, The Devil drum on the darkened pane: You did it, but was it Art?  We have learned to whittle the Eden Tree to the shape of a surplice-peg, We have learned to bottle our parents twain in the yelk of an addled egg, We know that the tail must wag the dog, for the horse is drawn by the cart; But the Devil whoops, as he whooped of old: It s clever, but is it Art?  When the flicker of London sun falls faint on the Club-rooms green and gold, The sons of Adam sit them down and scratch with their pens in the mould They scratch with their pens in the mould of their graves, and the ink and the anguish start, For the Devil mutters behind the leaves: It s pretty, but is it Art?  Now, if we could win to the Eden Tree where the Four Great Rivers flow, And the Wreath of Eve is red on the turf as she left it long ago, And if we could come when the sentry slept and softly scurry through, By the favor of God we might know as muchas our father Adam knew.',\n",

       " 'NOW this is the law of the jungle, as old and as true as the sky, And the wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the wolf that shall break it must die.  As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk, the law runneth forward and back; For the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack.  Wash daily from nose tip to tail tip; drink deeply, but never too deep; And remember the night is for hunting and forget not the day is for sleep.  The jackal may follow the tiger, but, cub, when thy whiskers are grown, Remember the wolf is a huntergo forth and get food of thy own.  Keep peace with the lords of the jungle, the tiger, the panther, the bear; And trouble not Hathi the Silent, and mock not the boar in his lair.  When pack meets with pack in the jungle, and neither will go from the trail, Lie down till the leaders have spoken; it may be fair words shall prevail.  When ye fight with a wolf of the pack ye must fight him alone and afar, Lest others take part in the quarrel and the pack is diminished by war.  The lair of the wolf is his refuge, and where he has made him his home, Not even the head wolf may enter, not even the council may come.  The lair of the wolf is his refuge, but where he has digged it too plain, The council shall send him a message, and so he shall change it again.  If ye kill before midnight be silent and wake not the woods with your bay, Lest ye frighten the deer from the crop and thy brothers go empty away.  Ye may kill for yourselves, and your mates, and your cubs as they need and ye can; But kill not for pleasure of killing, and seven times never kill man.  If ye plunder his kill from a weaker, devour not all in thy pride, Pack-right is the right of the meanest; so leave him the head and the hide.  The kill of the pack is the meat of the pack. Ye must eat where it lies; And no one may carry away of that meat to his lair, or he dies.  The kill of the wolf is the meat of the wolf. He may do what he will, But, till he is given permission, the pack may not eat of that kill.  Lair right is the right of the mother. From all of her years she may claim One haunch of each kill for her litter, and none may deny her the same.  Cub right is the right of the yearling. From all of his pack he may claim Full gorge when the killer has eaten; and none may refuse him the same.  Cave right is the right of the father, to hunt by himself for his own; He is freed from all calls to the pack. He is judged by the council alone.  Because of his age and his cunning, because of his gripe and his paw, In all that the law leaveth open the word of the head wolf is law.
