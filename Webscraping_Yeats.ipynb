There is no obstacle,But Gregory's Wood and one bare hill,Whereby the haystack and roof-levelling windBred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;,And for an hour I have walked and prayed,Because of the great gloom that is in my mind. I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour, ,And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower, ,And under the arches of the bridge, and scream ,In the elms above the flooded stream; ,Imagining in excited reverie ,That the future years had come,Dancing to a frenzied drum,Out of the murderous innocence of the sea. May she be granted beauty, and yet not,Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraughtOr hers before a looking-glass; for suchBeing made beautiful overmuchConsider beauty a sufficient endLose natural kindness, and maybe,The heart-revealing intimacy,That chooses right, and never find a friend. Helen, being chosen, found life flat and dullAnd later had much trouble from a fool;,While that great Queen that rose out of the sprayBeing fatherless, could have her wayYet chose a bandy-leggd smith for man.,It's certain that fine women eat,A crazy salad with their meat,Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone. In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;,Hearts are not had as a gift, but hearts are earned,By those that are not entirely beautiful.,Yet many, that have played the fool ,For beauty's very self, has charm made wise;,And many a poor man that has rovedLoved and thought himself belovedFrom a glad kindness cannot take his eyes. May she become a flourishing hidden treeThat all her thoughts may like the linnet beAnd have no business but dispensing round,Their magnanimities of sound;,Nor but in merriment begin a chaseNor but in merriment a quarrel.,Oh, may she live like some green laurel,Rooted in one dear perpetual place. My mind, because the minds that I have lovedThe sort of beauty that I have approvedProsper but little, has dried up of lateYet knows that to be choked with hate,May well be of all evil chances chief.,If there's no hatred in a mind,Assault and battery of the wind,Can never tear the linnet from the leaf. An intellectual hatred is the worstSo let her think opinions are accursed.,Have I not seen the loveliest woman born ,Out of the mouth of Plenty's hornBecause of her opinionated mind,Barter that horn and every good,By quiet natures understood,For an old bellows full of angry wind? Considering that, all hatred driven henceThe soul recovers radical innocence,And learns at last that it is self-delighting, ,Self-appeasing, self-affrightingAnd that its own sweet will is heaven's willShe can, though every face should scowl,And every windy quarter howl,Or every bellows burst, be happy still. And may her bridegroom bring her to a house,Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;,For arrogance and hatred are the wares,Peddled in the thoroughfares.,How but in custom and in ceremony,Are innocence and beauty born?,Ceremony's a name for the rich hornAnd custom for the spreading laurel tree.,\",\n",

       " 'WE ride but slowly though so near our home.\\nKing Eochaid said, and he that bore his shield\\nSighing replied: What need have we for haste\\nTowards the hour for speaking of the dead?\\nMy married sister put into my care\\nA boy of twenty years;a mound and stone\\nBetween the wood of Duras and Magai\\nHave been the measure of that care. But Eochaid,\\nHaving no thought but for his queen Edain,\\nOutrode his troop that after twelve months war\\nToiled with empounded cattle through the mire,\\nAnd came into a wood as the sun set\\nWestward of Tara. Where in the middle wood\\nA clump of beech trees made an empty space\\nHe thought to have given his horse the spur, but saw,\\nBetween the pale-green light of the beech leaves\\nAnd the ground ivys bluer light, a stag\\nWhiter than curds, its eyes the tint of the sea.\\nBecause it stood upon his path and seemed\\nMore hands in height than any stag in the world\\nHe sat with tightened rein amazed, his horse\\nTrembling beneath him, and then drove the spur\\nNot doubting to have shouldered it away.\\nBut the stag stooped its heavy branching horns,\\nAnd ran at him, and passed, and as it passed\\nRipped through the horses flanks. King Eochaid reeled,\\nBut drew his sword, and thought with levelled point\\nTo stay the stags next rush. When sword met horn\\nThe horn resounded as though it had been silver.\\nHorn locked in sword, they tugged and struggled there\\nAs though a stag and unicorn were met\\nIn Africa on mountain of the moon,\\nUntil at last the unlocked horn had torn\\nThrough the entrails of the horse. Dropping his sword\\nEochaid seized both the horns in his strong hands\\nAnd stared into the sea-green eyes, and so\\nHither and thither to and fro they trod\\nTill all the place was beaten into mire.\\nThe strong thigh and the agile thigh were met\\nThe hands that gathered up the might of the world,\\nAnd hoof and horn that had sucked in their speed\\nAmid the elaborate wilderness of the air.\\nThrough bush they plunged and over ivied root\\nAnd where the stone struck fire, while in the leaves\\nA squirrel whinnied and a bird screamed out;\\nBut when at last he forced those sinewy flanks\\nAgainst a beech bole he threw down the beast\\nAnd knelt above it with drawn knife. On the instant\\nIt vanished like a shadow, and a cry,\\nSo mournful that it seemed the cry of one\\nWho had lost some unimaginable treasure,\\nWandered between the blue and the green leaf\\nAnd climbed into the air, crumbling away\\nTill all had seemed a shadow or a vision\\nBut for the trodden mire, the pool of blood,\\nThe disembowelled horse. King Eochaid gazed,\\nAnd then, as terror-stricken as a child\\nWho has seen a garden image or twisted tree\\nIn the half light, and runs to its own door\\nIts terror growing wilder at every foot-fall,\\nHe ran towards the house his fathers built\\nOn peopled Tara, nor stood to draw his breath\\nUntil he came before the painted wall,\\nThe posts of polished yew, circled with bronze,\\nOf the great door; but though the hanging lamps\\nShowed their faint light through the unshuttered windows,\\nNor door, nor mouth, nor slipper made a noise,\\nNor on the ancient beaten paths, that wound\\nFrom well side or from plough land, was their noise;\\nAnd there had been no sound of living thing\\nBefore him or behind, but that far-off\\nOn the horizon edge bellowed the herds.\\nKnowing that silence brings no good to kings,\\nAnd mocks returning victory, he passed\\nBetween the pillars with a beating heart\\nAnd saw where in the midst of the great hall,\\nPale-faced, alone upon a bench, his wife\\nSat upright with a sword before her feet.\\nA kind mild woman had she been, who poured\\nHer beauty as the constellations pour\\nTheir richness through the summer and the spring;\\nBut now she had no mild and no kind look:\\nHer hands on either side had gripped the bench,\\nHer eyes were cold and steady, her lips tight.\\nSome passion had made her stone. Hearing a foot\\nShe started and then knew whose foot it was;\\nBut when he thought to take her in his arms\\nShe motioned him afar, and rose and spoke:\\nI have sent out into the fields and woods\\nThe fighting men and servants of this house,\\nFor I would have your judgment upon one\\nWho is self-accused. If she be innocent\\nShe would not look in any known mans face\\nTill judgment has been given, and if guilty,\\nBecause that were a guilt against her king,\\nWill never look again on known mans face.\\nAnd at these words he paled, as she had paled,\\nKnowing that he should find upon her lips\\nThe meaning of that monstrous day.Then she:\\nYou brought me where your brother Ardan sat\\nAlways in his one seat, and bid me care him\\nThrough that strange illness that had fixed him there,\\nAnd should he die to heap his burial mound\\nAnd raise his pillar stone. King Eochaid said,\\nGazing upon her with bewildered eyes:\\nIf he be living still the whole worlds mine,\\nBut if not living, half the world is lost.\\nI bid them make his bed under this roof,\\nAnd carried him his food with my own hands,\\nAnd so the weeks passed by. But when I said,\\nWhat is this trouble? he would answer nothing,\\nThough always at my words his trouble grew.\\nAnd I, that I might find and stub it out,\\nBut asked the more until he spoke these words,\\nWeary of many questions: There are things\\nThat make the heart akin to the dumb stone.\\nThen I replied: Although you hide a secret,\\nDearer than any that the dumb stone hides,\\nSpeak it, that I may send through the wide world\\nFor medicine. Thereon he cried aloud:\\nDay after day you question me, and I,\\nBecause there is such a storm amid my thoughts\\nI shall be carried in the gust, command\\nForbid, beseech and waste my breath. Then I:\\nAlthough the thing that you have hid were evil\\nThe speaking of it could be no great wrong;\\nAnd evil must it be, if done twere worse\\nThan mound and stone that keep all virtue in\\nAnd loosen on us dreams that waste our life,\\nShadows and shows that can but turn the brain.\\nBut finding him still silent I stooped down,\\nAnd, whispering that none but he should hear,\\nSaid: If a woman has put this on you\\nMy men, whether it please her or displease,\\nAnd though they have to cross the Loughlan seas\\nAnd take her in the middle of armed men,\\nShall make her look upon her handiwork\\nThat she may quench the rick she has fired, and though\\nShe may have worn silk clothes, or worn a crown,\\nShell not be proud, knowing within her heart\\nThat our sufficient portion of the world\\nIs that we give, although it be brief giving\\nHappiness to children and to men.\\nThen he, driven by his thought beyond his thought,\\nAnd speaking what he would not though he would,\\nSighed: You, even you yourself could work the cure.\\nAnd at those words I rose and I went out\\nAnd for nine days he had food from other hands,\\nAnd for nine days my mind went whirling round\\nThe one disastrous zodiac, muttering\\nThat the immedicable wounds beyond\\nQuestion of ours, beyond our pity even.\\nBut when nine days had gone I stood again\\nBefore his chair, and bending down my head\\nTold him, that when Orion rose, and all\\nThe women of his household were asleep,\\nTo gofor hope would give his limbs the power\\nTo an old empty woodmans house thats hidden\\nClose to a clump of beech trees in the wood\\nWestward of Tara, there to await a friend\\nThat could, as he had told her, work his cure,\\nAnd would be no harsh friend.When night had deepened\\nI groped my way through boughs, and over roots,\\nTill oak and hazel ceased and beech began,\\nAnd found the house, a sputtering torch within,\\nAnd, stretched out sleeping on a pile of skins,\\nArdan; and though I called to him and tried\\nTo shake him out of sleep I could not rouse him.\\nI waited till the night was on the turn,\\nThen fearing that some labourer, on his way\\nTo plough or pasture land, might see me there\\nWent out.Among the ivy-covered rocks,\\nAs on the blue light of a sword, a man\\nWho had unnatural majesty, and eyes\\nLike the eyes of some great kite scouring the woods,\\nStood on my path. Trembling from hand to foot\\nI gazed at him like grouse upon a kite,\\nBut with a voice that had unnatural music\\nA weary wooing and a long, he said,\\nSpeaking of love through other lips and looking\\nUnder an alien eyelid, for it was my craft\\nThat put a passion in the sleeper there,\\nAnd when I had got my will and drawn you here,\\nWhere I may speak to you alone, my craft\\nSucked up the passion out of him again\\nAnd left mere sleep. Hell wake when the sun wakes,\\nPush out his vigorous limbs and rub his eyes\\nAnd wonder what has ailed him these twelve months.\\nI cowered back upon the wall in terror\\nBut that sweet-sounding voice ran on: Woman,\\nI was your husband when you rode the air,\\nDanced in the whirling foam and in the dust\\nIn days you have not kept in memory,\\nBeing betrayed into a cradle; and I come\\nThat I may claim you as my wife again.\\nI was no longer terrified, his voice\\nHad half wakened some old memory,\\nYet answered him: I am King Eochaids wife,\\nAnd with him have found every happiness\\nWomen can find. With a most burning voice\\nThat made the body seem as it were a string\\nUnder a bow, he cried: What happiness\\nCan lovers have that know their happiness\\nMust end at the dumb stone, but where we build\\nOur sudden palaces in the still air\\nPleasure itself can bring no weariness,\\nNor can time waste the cheek, nor is there foot\\nThat has grown weary of the whirling dance,\\nNor an unlaughing mouth, but mine that mourns,\\nAmong those mouths that sing their sweethearts praise,\\nYour empty bed. How should I love, I answered,\\nWere it not that when the dawn has lit my bed\\nAnd shown my husband sleeping there I have sighed,\\nYour strength and nobleness will pass away.\\nOr how should love be worth its pains were it not\\nThat when he has fallen asleep within my arms,\\nBeing wearied out, I love in man the child?\\nWhat can they know of love that do not know\\nShe builds her nest upon a narrow ledge\\nAbove a windy precipice? Then he:\\nSeeing that when you come to the death-bed\\nYou must return, whether you would or no,\\nThis human life blotted from memory,\\nWhy must I live some thirty, forty years,\\nAlone with all this useless happiness?\\nThereon he seized me in his arms, but I\\nThrust him away with both my hands and cried:\\nNever will I believe theres any change\\nCan blot out of my memory this life\\nSweetened by death, but if I could believe\\nThat were a double hunger on my lips\\nFor what is doubly brief.But now the shape,\\nMy hands were pressed to, vanished suddenly.\\nI staggered, but a beech tree stayed my fall,\\nAnd clinging to it I could hear the cocks\\nCrow upon Tara.She had fixed her eyes\\nUpon Kind Eochaids face, who lowered his face\\nAnd touched her forehead with his lips and said:\\nI thank you for your kindness to my brother,\\nAnd for the love that you have shown your king,\\nFor that you promised, and for that refused.\\n\\nThereon the bellowing of the empounded herds\\nRose round the walls, and through the bronze-ringed door\\nJostled and shouted those war-wasted men,\\nAnd in the midst King Eochaids brother stood.\\nHed heard that din on the horizons edge\\nAnd ridden out to welcome them, and now,\\nGiving his hand to that man and to this,\\nPraised their great victories and gave them joy\\nOf their return to that ancestral house.\\n',\n",
