          <h3>Poetry</h3>
          <p><i>Poetry begins in trivial metaphors, pretty metaphors, ‘grace’ metaphors, and goes on to the profoundest thinking that we have. Poetry provides the one permissible way of saying one thing and meaning another. ... Unless you are at home in the metaphor, unless you have had your proper poetical education in the metaphor, you are not safe anywhere.</i></p>
          <p align = "right">–Robert Frost, <i>Education by Poetry</i> (1931)</p>
          <br>
          <p>My high school literature professors introduced me to some of poetry's classics: how creatives (in the literary arts) express themselves through the power and the imagery of the written word. At the time (and until now), I cannot say that I have wholly understood the depth and appreciated the beauty of each poem.</p>
          <p>Equipped with some knowledge of natural language processing (NLP), I attempt to figure out what the poets are saying by extracting the poem's important words and predicting the sentiments that the authors were trying to convey.</p>
          <p>I opted to look more deeply into the works of three poets: Robert Frost, William Butler Yeats, and Rudyard Kipling. Yeats and Kipling both received Nobel Prizes for literature while Frost was nominated for the same award 31 times. Frost received four Pulitzer Prizes. Results from NLP help provide a preview of the poem. The poem is included as well.</p>

          <h3>NLP Overview</h3>
          <p>The code I used here, and detailed explanations, can be found in my GitHub repository: <a href = "https://github.com/rochiecuevas/poetry">https://github.com/rochiecuevas/poetry</a>.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Collected poems.</b> The poems were obtained from different poetry websites through webscraping using the <a href = "https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a> Python library. Webscraping allowed me to automate the extraction of poems from the websites.</li>
            <li><b>Measured of Term Importance.</b> Term importance was calculated based on a metric called <i>term frequency-inverse document frequency</i> (TF-IDF). Term frequency is the number of times a term appears in a document. Inverse document frequency, on the other hand, is the calculated based on the inverse fraction of the number of documents in which the term appears in the corpus (set of documents). A high TF-IDF, therefore, indicates that a term occurs frequently in a document but not in all documents in the corpus; hence, it can be used as a keyword that distinguishes that document among the others in the corpus. On the other hand, a low TF-IDF is reached when a term appears in many documents within the corpus. More about TF-IDF <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">here</a>.</li>
            <li><b>Analysed Sentiment.</b> I used the Python <a href = "https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/">TextBlob</a> module because it is capable of unsupervised sentiment analysis. This means that it can predict if a poem is positive or negative just based on the words included in it; I didn't have to train a model using a pre-classified training data set.</li>
